## ℹ️ Overview

**Breathe** is a mental wellness companion designed to provide immediate, accessible support for anxiety management. Whether you're experiencing a stressful moment or building a long-term mindfulness practice, this app offers science-backed breathing techniques, personalized encouragement, and tools to understand your emotional patterns.

### Why I Built This

Mental health tools should be **accessible, immediate, and non-judgmental**. After recognizing the need for quick, effective anxiety relief that doesn't require appointments or prescriptions, I built Breathe to:

- Provide instant guided breathing exercises backed by research on anxiety reduction
- Offer personalized AI affirmations that adapt to your current emotional state
- Enable self-awareness through mood tracking and journaling
- Create a calming, distraction-free space for emotional processing

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate AI thoughtfully into wellness products while prioritizing user experience and accessibility.

}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "affirmation": "It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now. Take a deep breath—you're doing better than you think, and this moment will pass."
}
```

---

### POST `/log-anxiety`
Record anxiety level to database with timestamp.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "level": 7,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-21T14:30:00Z"

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Calming Visual Language
- **Soft Color Palette** — Gentle blues, purples, and neutrals to promote relaxation
- **Glassmorphism** — Frosted glass effects create depth without harshness
- **Smooth Animations** — No jarring movements; everything flows naturally
- **Minimalist Layout** — Reduced visual clutter to prevent overwhelm

### User-Centered Approach
- **No Login Required** — Immediate access to breathing exercises (data stored locally)
- **Optional Tracking** — Users choose whether to log mood data
- **Privacy-First** — All data stored locally; affirmations don't retain personal info
- **Accessible Controls** — Large touch targets, clear labels, keyboard navigation

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Breathing Exercise Flow
1. User selects "Start Breathing Exercise"
2. Three.js initializes particle system
3. Visual/audio cues guide through inhale (4s) → hold (7s) → exhale (8s)
4. Particles expand/contract in sync with breathing phases
5. Cycle repeats for user-defined duration
6. Optional anxiety level logging post-exercise

### AI Affirmation Generation
1. User rates current anxiety level (1-10 slider)
2. Frontend sends level to `/generate-affirmation` endpoint
3. Flask backend constructs GPT-4 prompt with anxiety context
4. OpenAI generates personalized, calming affirmation
5. Message displayed with gentle fade-in animation
6. User can regenerate or save affirmation

### Anxiety Tracking Visualization
1. User logs anxiety levels over time via `/log-anxiety`
2. SQLite stores entries with timestamps
3. Frontend fetches data from `/get-anxiety-data`
4. Chart.js renders line graph showing mood trends
5. Users can identify patterns, triggers, and progress

# View anxiety logs in SQLite
sqlite3 instance/anxiety.db
sqlite> SELECT * FROM anxiety_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Testing API Endpoints
```bash
# Test affirmation generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate-affirmation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"anxietyLevel": 8}'

# Test anxiety logging
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/log-anxiety \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"level": 6, "timestamp": "2025-01-21T15:00:00Z"}'
```

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` file in root:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_sessions
```
